Capsize was developed by Matthew Wojtechko and John-Paul Depew. All rights reserved.

The central mechanic of Capsize – namely, flipping the environment to walk on the ceiling – was a promising idea that my classmate John-Paul Depew and I knew could produce dozens of
fun spatial puzzles necessitating players to view problems from multiple perspectives. This mechanic led to the locale of a spaceship with shifting gravity, which we eventually
decided would be under attack from explosive missile strikes! With five weeks to complete development for a grade in an advanced game development class, my partner created the
mechanics and many objects in the game, while I mapped out and implemented the puzzles.
